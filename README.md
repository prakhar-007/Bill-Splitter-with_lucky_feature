# Bill-Splitter-Basic-
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

Work on your Python basics and take a look at more advanced data structures such as dictionaries. Develop a code for managing expenses during your next dine-out.

Added a new feature to the project â€” pick one name from the dictionary at random; this person's share will be paid by others. Make it a lucky day for somebody!

Make sure you give your users a choice whether they want to use this feature or not. Don't turn it on by default.

After picking a random name, print it so that everyone knows who is the lucky one.
